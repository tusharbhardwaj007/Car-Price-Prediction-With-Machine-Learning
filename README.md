# Car-Price-Prediction-With-Machine-Learning
Car price prediction with machine learning is the process of using algorithms to estimate the price of a car based on its attributes and historical data.
By analyzing features like make, model, year, mileage, and fuel type, machine learning models can predict the car's market value. 
This involves collecting and preprocessing data, selecting and training a model, and evaluating its performance to make accurate predictions.
